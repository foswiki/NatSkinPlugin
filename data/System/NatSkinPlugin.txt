This is the supplemental plugin for the NatSkin. Its main purpose is to supply
"skin states" to control different styles and variations to be switched
dynamically while you are online. 

The documentation of the NatSkinPlugin only covers the additional tags that have
been implemented. Have a look at the NatSkin topic for more information.

---++ Syntax

---+++ CURREV
*Syntax*: =%<nop>CURREV%= 

returns the current topic revision

see also: 
[[#NATMAXREV][NATMAXREV]], 
[[#NATREVISIONS][NATREVISIONS]]
[[#PREVREV][PREVREV]], 

---+++ FORMBUTTON
*Syntax*: =%<nop>FORMBUTTON{";lt;format>"}%=

returns a link on to add or change the form attached to a topic. This
will be shown on the edit screen depending on WEBFORMs being defined or not.
More precisely FORMBUTTON returns
   * an empty string if there are no WEBFORMS defined
   * or an "Add form" link if there are but no form is attached yet
   * or a "Change form" link to change the current form

The optional =%lt;format>= string may contain the following variables
   * =$url=: the url of the link
   * =$action=: the link text 
   * =$1=: the complete anchor including the link and the text

For example =%<nop>FORMBUTTON{"| $1"}%= will generate a pipe and the formbutton
if possible. See the =edit.nat.tmpl= template file of the !NatSkin.

---+++ KNOWNSTYLES
*Syntax*: =%<nop>KNOWNSTYLES%= 

returns a list of all known skin styles. 

---+++ KNOWNVARIATIONS
*Syntax*: =%<nop>KNOWNVARIATIONS%= 

returns a list of all known styles variations.

---+++ NATFORMLIST
*Syntax*: =%<nop>NATFORMLIST{...}%=

returns a formatted list of forms that can be attached to a topic. typically used
in the =changeform= skin template.
paramters:
   * =header=
   * =format=
   * =footer=
   * =separator=
   * =selected=
   * =web=
   * =topic=

---+++ NATMAXREV
*Syntax*: =%<nop>NATMAXREV%= 

substitute for =%<nop>MAXREV%= which differes all too much on Beijing, Cairo
and Dakar. This version grants to behave the same.

---+++ NATREVISIONS
*Syntax*: =%<nop>NATREVISIONS%= 

substitute for the =%<nop>REVISIONS%= tag which only works on 
the <nop>PatternSkin.

---+++ NATWEBLOGO
*Syntax*: =%<nop>NATWEBLOGO{format="..."}%=

returns either a textual or a graphical a logo to be used in the header bar
depending on a set of preference variables.

NATWEBLOGO will check for a couple of preference variables in the following order:
   1 return =%<nop>NATWEBLOGONAME%= if defined
   1 return =%<nop>NATWEBLOGOIMG%= if defined
   1 return =%<nop>WEBLOGOIMG%= if defined
   1 return =%<nop>WIKITOOLNAME%= if defined
   1 or return the string 'Foswiki' otherwise

Given you want to have the string <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% in the logo position
when using NatSkin but not so when using a different skin on the same site.
Then add the following to the %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences:
<verbatim>
  * Set NATWEBLOGONAME = %WIKITOOLNAME%
  * Set WEBLOGOIMG = /path/to/your/defaultlogo.gif
</verbatim>

If you want to have a different logo using NatSkin than using another skin on the same site
then add the following to  the %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences:
<verbatim>
  * Set NATWEBLOGOIMG = /path/to/your/natskinlogo.gif
  * Set WEBLOGOIMG = /path/to/your/defaultlogo.gif
</verbatim>

---+++ PREVREV
*Syntax*: =%<nop>PREVREV%= 

returns the previous topic revision taking =NumberOfRevisions= into account 

---+++ USERACTIONS
*Syntax*: =%<nop>USERACTIONS{"&lt;format>" ...}%= 

display separate sets of actions for anonymous or authenticated users.
   * sep="&lt;span> class="natSep">|&lt;/span>": separator between actions
   * guest="$login$sep$register$sep$print": format string of actions for guests
   * format="$user$sep$logout$sep$print&lt;br />$edit$sep$attach$sep$move$sep$raw$sep$diff$sep$more":
     format string of actions for authenticated users
   * restrictedactions="...": list of user actions that are disabled if the user
     has got no write access to the current topic
   * help="...": help topic used for =$help=, defaults to %SYSTEMWEB%.UsersGuide (see below)

The "guest" and "format" format strings can use the following variables
   * $attach: link to "attach" topic action
   * $diff: link to diff
   * $edit: link to edit
   * $help: link to a help page
   * $login: link to log in
   * $logout: link to log out
   * $more: link to more dialog
   * $move: link to move dialog
   * $pdf: link to export pdf using the <nop>GenPDFAddOn
   * $print: link to print action
   * $raw: link to display topic in raw format
   * $register: link to registration
   * $sep: separator string
   * $user: name of current authenticated user


---+++ WEBCOMPONENT
*Syntax*: =%<nop>WEBCOMPONENT{"name" web="&lt;name>" lineprefix="&lt;prefix>" multiple="<anything>"}%=

*Arguments*:
   * =name=: The name of the !WebComponent topic.
   * =web="&lt;name>"=: The web to fetch the component from. Default to the current web.
   * =lineprefix="&lt;prefix>"=: A prefix to be added to each line of the web component topic before inclusion. Typically three space characters.
   * =multiple= : If defined WEBCOMPONENT will allow for multiple inclusions of the same web component topic.

display a web component. A web component "<nop>MyComponent" is searched looking for
   1 <nop>WebMyComponent in the current web,
   2 <nop>SiteMyComponent in the %USERSWEB% web,
   3 <nop>SiteMyComponent in the %SYSTEMWEB% web and
   4 <nop>WebMyComponent in the %SYSTEMWEB% web.

The WEBCOMPONENT tag will retrieve the component where it was found
first. Thereby the component can be customize for each web separately if required. If it is
not defined locally a predefined component will be returned. Components
can be predefined in the %USERSWEB% and the %SYSTEMWEB% where the name
of the component is prefix with "Site" to distinguish them from the
local web components that may already be present in the %USERSWEB% and the %SYSTEMWEB%.
As a last resort the local components of the %SYSTEMWEB% are used.

By default the NatSkin comes with predefined components 
   * [[%SYSTEMWEB%.SiteBottomBar]]: page bottom
   * [[%SYSTEMWEB%.SiteButtons]]: horizontal navigation
   * [[%SYSTEMWEB%.SiteLinks]]: link section inside sidebar component
   * [[%SYSTEMWEB%.SiteSideBar]]: sidebar navigation
   * [[%SYSTEMWEB%.SiteRightBar]]: right sidebar navigation, used in three columns layout (stylesidebar = both)
   * [[%SYSTEMWEB%.SiteTopicActions]]: topic actions
   * [[%SYSTEMWEB%.SiteHtmlHead]] (deprecated)
