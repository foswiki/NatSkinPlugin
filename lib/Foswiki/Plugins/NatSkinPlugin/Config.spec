# **SELECT fixed,fluid,bordered **

# and wide content, like large tables. 'fixed' is a typical center aligned blog-like layout that limits
# the text width to a readable size while the content area will still resize proportional to the font width. 
# 'Bordered' is very similar to the fluid width layout but adds extra white space around the content.

# **SELECT left,right,both,none**

# of the main content area. 'None' switches off any skin-driven sidebars. This is useful when columns are designed inside
# the content area directly instead of being controlled by the template engine.
